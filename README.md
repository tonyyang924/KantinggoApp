# KantinggoApp

This is the topic of our university graduation, is a traveling app to guide people how to go to Kenting and there are fun spots in there.

* Developed the app with Java and a little JavaScript. I mainly developed the app part with Java and the other designed by my teammate. Use Google Maps API for location based service.
